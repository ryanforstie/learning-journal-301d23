# LJ Code 301 - Day 14-15

## We started working with middleware, its extremely important but very complicated when you first see it.

### Middleware
* Page.js
    * Offers us a series of helpers to handle certain functionality based on the routes defined in our app, kind of like middleware.
    * The most notable is Context (ctx) and next() function.
        * Context lets us manage state and persist.
        * Next() is used in express.js and allows us to move to the next callback defined in the route.
    * ctx.params.id (URL params) - allows us to access specific url on client side
    * request.params.id - allows us to access specific url on server side
        * ‘/user/:id’ - this is how we work with url params

## Last day was a good review day, I captured what we reviewed below.

  ### Review

        * Functional Programming
            * Common methods used
                * Map, reduce, filter, forEach
            * Checkout the slide deck
        * PageJS [ExpressJS]
            * Facilitates client-side routing (how we deliver content)
            * URL as an API: part of the UI
            * Reference point - you are here, active manipulation of window content
            * SPEED - don’t have to do full request, response cycle
            * Gateway to server side routing
        * IIFE
            * Makes a function execute its self
            * Run on page load
            * Document.ready()
            * Functions create scope
            * When working in a modular app, you need to wrap all functions in an IIFE
            * You don’t know javascript book
        * Var
            * ES5 and prior
            * Function level scoping
        * Let
            * ES6
            * Block level scoping
            * { } - everything in curly brackets are blocks
        * Const
            * ES6
            * Disallows reassignment of a variable to a different data type or value
