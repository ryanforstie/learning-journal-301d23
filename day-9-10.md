# LJ Code 301 - Day 9-10

## We started working with SQL and I found out that it is a very strict language and you cannot miss semi colons. It is also harder to debug because you do not get the blatant errors in the console like you do when testing JS.

SQL
* NORMALIZE DATABASE
    * DROP TABLE articles;
        * We will be creating a table for articles and author
    * CREATE TABLE authors
        * id, name, url
    * CREATE TABLE articles
        * Id, title, authorId, markdown, publishedOn

    * SELECT AS AS - select query with inner join, join the tables together
        * FROM, INNER JOIN, ON, ORDER BY DESC

## We also started using functional programming and the map, filter, and reduce methods. Very difficult lab but a very good one. I know this lab will provide me with some very powerful tools to use for manipulating huge amounts of data if I want to.
