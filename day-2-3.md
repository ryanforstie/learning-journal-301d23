# LJ Code 301 - Day 2-3

## Time management is something we need to consider, spend 2 hours on lab assignments and portfolio. 1 hour on code wars, then learning journal and readings.

## Agile is another concept we learned, it consist of standup meetings, pair programming, and user stories.

## Starting to get our feet wet in jQuery and seeing how much shorter it is than vanilla js.

## Day 3 lab was the hardest one so far, need to really pay attention of id s and classes that you are targeting with jQuery.
