    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes
    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements
* Its very important to understand the code you are working on, you need to practice talking about it to fully understand it.

* A selection of useful events: (p 246-247)
* React JS is the most popular JS right now.

Lab

    * Is the Model, set's up data.
