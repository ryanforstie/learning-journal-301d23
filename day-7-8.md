# LJ Code 301 - Day 7-8

## We started using Node JS and I wanted to save this process because it sums up what we did.

## NPM Commands
* npm i - when we already have a package.json file in our file structure of our project. It installs all dependencies already defined.
* npm init - creates package.json INITIALIZE
* npm i --save <dependency> - add the dependency + version to the package.json and download the node_modules

NPM Process
* Use existing project
    * Navigate to the directory level where package.json and server.js are
        * npm i
* Initialize new project
    * Scaffold project
        * npm init
        * npm i --save <dependency> (for all dependencies)
        * Write code using dependencies
    * What if I need more dependencies?
        * npm i --save <dependency>

## We also started to get into SQL and Postgres, right now its pretty complicated but in time ill start to understand it better and use it.
