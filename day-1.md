MVC (Model, View, Controller)
    WRRC = Web Request/ Response Cycle
* User makes a request to server, the server makes a query to the database, database gives results to server, server gives response to user.

Working with the Web
* As consumers we have experience with the view layer. In 201 we learned to build for the view.
* In 301 we learn to use/consume the full stack. We will learn this by learning the View, Model, and the Controller.
* In 401 we learn to build the full stack.
